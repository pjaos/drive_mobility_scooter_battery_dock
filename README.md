# Drive Mobility Scooter Dock.
I built this dock for a drive mobility scooter battery. The dock uses the battery charger supplied with the mobility scooter to charge the battery.

A panel meter in the dock is used to show the voltage and current when charging.

The mobility scooter model that this project was generated for, is the [AutoFold Elite](https://drivedevilbiss.co.uk/our-products/powered-mobility-wheelchairs/scooters/folding-scooters/autofold-elite).

# Hardware
I 3D printed the case parts detailed in the case folder. These were created using FreeCad V1.0. There are three required parts, the top, base and the pogo pin panel. I printed these using Bambulab PETG-CF filament on a Bambulab X1C printer.

## Parts Required.
As well as the 3D printed parts the following parts are also required.

### Panel Meter
The panel meter is available on amazon and ebay.

A link to the panel meter used can be found @ https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B085QDY11D/ref=twister_B09YV7KRQB?_encoding=UTF8&th=1

### Fuse Holder
A single 20 mm panel mount fuse holder is required. These can be found on amazon or ebay. If the fuse holder you use do not have a flat to stop them turning in the hole you will need to file the flat off the hole in the case to fit them.
I fitted a 3A 20mm fuse to the fuse folder.

An example of these is shown below.

### H113 Pogo pins
These were purchased from Aliexpress

Four M3 brass threaded inserts are required. These can be found on amazon or ebay.

An example of these is shown below.

## Assembly
The parts were connected as detailed in the following schematic.

![Schematic](images/schematic.png)

__It is important that the pogo pins are fitted to the pogo pin panel in the dock at the correct height. They should be fitted such that when compressed to 6mm (panel surface to top of pogo pin) there is still some travel left on the pogo pin. To do this use a 3.5mm drill to drill out the four holes on the pogo pin panel leaving the small hole at the bottom of the hole for the pogo pin connector to protrude through.__

Four M3 brass thread inserts were added to the 3D printed base part to allow four M3 x 10mm countersunk screws to be fitted (two on each side). I used black nylon screws. These hold the top to the base.

## Battery
The mobility scooter battery that the dock charges had the following label for identification.
