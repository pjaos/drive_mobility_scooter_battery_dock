# Drive Mobility Scooter Dock.
I built this dock for a drive mobility scooter battery. The dock uses the
battery charger supplied with the mobility scooter to charge the battery.

The mobility scooter model that this project was generated for is [AutoFold Elite](https://drivedevilbiss.co.uk/our-products/powered-mobility-wheelchairs/scooters/folding-scooters/autofold-elite). This same battery is used in other models of mobility scooter.

## Battery
The battery that the dock charges had the following label for identification.

# Hardware
To build the hardware you'll need to 3d print the files in the case folder. These were created using FreeCad V1.0. There are three required parts, the top, base and the pogo pin panel. I printed these using PETG-CF filament.
